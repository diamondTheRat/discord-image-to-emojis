Really scuffed, might not work

# Instructions
- create a new discord server
- copy the guild id and channel id of where you want to send it
- choose an image
- get your discord token(or a bots discord token, didnt test for bots so it might not work)
- run it and wait

# Disclaimer
Purge will delete all emojis in that server so dont enable it unless u want that.
Discord rate limits you so hard that this only works once in a server then u have to wait god knows how long.
